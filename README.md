# deskbrid

**The HAL your Linux desktop agents are missing.**

A single daemon that wraps GNOME Shell, DBus, NetworkManager, BlueZ, PipeWire, and Wayland utilities into a JSON-over-Unix-socket protocol. One binary. Your shell scripts and AI agents use the same socket.

```bash
# A human using the CLI
deskbrid windows list
deskbrid keyboard type "git push origin main"

# An AI agent using the same socket
{"action": "windows.list"}
→ {"type": "response", "data": [{"title": "PatchHive — VS Code", "app_id": "code", ...}]}

{"action": "windows.focus", "window_id": "0x..."}
{"action": "input.keyboard", "action": "type", "text": "Hey Codex, fix the build\n"}
```

## Why now

Every major AI lab is racing to ship desktop agents — and Linux is the gap nobody has solved cleanly. AppleScript gives macOS agents native control. Windows has UI Automation. Linux has... `xdotool` that breaks on Wayland.

Deskbrid is the missing abstraction layer. It doesn't bet on agents taking off — automation use cases validate it today, agents validate it tomorrow. Same daemon, same protocol, same socket.

## Real-world example: an AI agent opening VS Code

```
→ {"action": "windows.list"}
← {"type": "response", "data": [
    {"title": "PatchHive — Visual Studio Code", "app_id": "code", "id": "0x3a0000b", ...},
    {"title": "praxis/src/daemon.rs — Visual Studio Code", "app_id": "code", "id": "0x2c0000a", ...}
  ]}

→ {"action": "windows.focus", "window_id": "0x3a0000b"}   # Bring PatchHive to front
← {"type": "response", "status": "ok"}

→ {"action": "input.mouse", "action": "move", "x": 900, "y": 920}
→ {"action": "input.mouse", "action": "click", "button": "left"}   # Click Codex chat input
→ {"action": "input.keyboard", "action": "type", "text": "Fix the build errors\n"}
```

The agent picks the right window by title, focuses it, clicks into the chat, and types.

## One-minute demo

```bash
# Fire up the daemon
deskbrid daemon &

# Query your desktop
deskbrid system info
deskbrid windows list
deskbrid battery
deskbrid network status

# Interact
deskbrid clipboard read
deskbrid screenshot
deskbrid notification send "deskbrid" "Hello" "👋"

# Watch for file changes
deskbrid subscribe '["file.*"]'    # then touch /tmp/test — you'll see events
```

## Install

|---|---|---|
| **Python** | ✅ Done | `pip install ./clients/python/` |
| **Rust** (built-in CLI) | ✅ Done | `cargo install deskbrid` |
| TypeScript | 🔄 Planned | `npm install deskbrid` |

### Python

```python
from deskbrid import Deskbrid

client = Deskbrid()

# Subscribe to events
@client.on("file.*")
def on_file_change(event):
    print(f"File changed: {event['path']}")

# Actions
client.windows_list()
client.keyboard_type("deploy production\n")
text = client.clipboard_read()
path = client.screenshot()

client.listen()  # blocks, streaming events
```

## How it works

Deskbrid is a single Rust binary that binds a Unix socket at `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/deskbrid.sock`. Every interaction is one JSON line → one JSON line. Agents subscribe to events by sending `{"action": "subscribe", "events": ["file.*"]}` and get pushed events as they happen.

Under the hood it talks to:
- **GNOME Shell** via DBus (windows, workspaces)
- **Mutter** (IdleMonitor)
- **NetworkManager** (network status, WiFi)
- **BlueZ** (Bluetooth)
- **UPower** (battery)
- **org.freedesktop.Notifications** (notifications)
- **grim** (Wayland screenshots)
- **wtype** (keyboard injection)
- **ydotool** (mouse control)
- **wl-paste/wl-copy** (clipboard)
- **pactl** (audio)
- **notify crate** (file watching with inotify)
